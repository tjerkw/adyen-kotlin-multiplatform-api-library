**requestedTestErrorResponseCode** | **kotlin.String** | Triggers test scenarios that allow to replicate certain communication errors.  Allowed values: * **NO_CONNECTION_AVAILABLE** – There wasn&#39;t a connection available to service the outgoing communication. This is a transient, retriable error since no messaging could be initiated to an issuing system (or third-party acquiring system). Therefore, the header Transient-Error: true is returned in the response. A subsequent request using the same idempotency key will be processed as if it was the first request. * **IOEXCEPTION_RECEIVED** – Something went wrong during transmission of the message or receiving the response. This is a classified as non-transient because the message could have been received by the issuing party and been acted upon. No transient error header is returned. If using idempotency, the (error) response is stored as the final result for the idempotency key. Subsequent messages with the same idempotency key not be processed beyond returning the stored response. |  [optional]
**allowPartialAuth** | **kotlin.String** | Set to true to authorise a part of the requested amount in case the cardholder does not have enough funds on their account.

To enable this functionality, contact our Support Team. |  [optional]
**authorisationType** | **kotlin.String** | Flags a card payment request for either pre-authorisation or final authorisation.

**customRoutingFlag** | **kotlin.String** | Allows you to determine or override the acquirer account that should be used for the transaction.  If you need to process a payment with an acquirer different from a default one, you can set up a corresponding configuration on the Adyen payments platform. Then you can pass a custom routing flag in a payment request&#39;s additional data to target a specific acquirer.

**industryUsage** | [**inline**](#IndustryUsage) | In case of [asynchronous authorisation adjustment](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/adjust-authorisation#adjust-authorisation), this field denotes why the additional payment is made.  Possible values:   * **NoShow**: An incremental charge is carried out because of a no-show for a guaranteed reservation.   * **DelayedCharge**: An incremental charge is carried out to process an additional payment after the original services have been rendered and the respective payment has been processed. |  [optional]
