/**
 * Transfers API
 *
 * >Versions 1 and 2 of the Transfers API are deprecated. If you are just starting your implementation, use the latest version.  This API provides endpoints that you can use to transfer funds, whether when [paying out to a transfer instrument](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/payout-to-users/on-demand-payouts), [sending funds to third parties](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/business-accounts/send-receive-funds) for users with business bank accounts, or to [request a payout for a grant offer](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/capital). The API also supports use cases for [getting transactions for business bank accounts](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/business-accounts/transactions-api) and getting [grants and its outstanding balances](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/capital#get-balances). .  ## Authentication Your Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:   ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ ... ```  Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:  ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -U \"ws@BalancePlatform.YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM\":\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\" \\ ... ``` ## Roles and permissions To use the Transfers API, you need an additional role for your API credential. Transfers must also be enabled for the source balance account. Your Adyen contact will set up the roles and permissions for you. ## Versioning The Transfers API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/btl/v4/transfers ``` ## Going live When going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API credential for the live environment. You can then use the username and password to send requests to `https://balanceplatform-api-live.adyen.com/btl/v4`.

/**
 * 
 *
 * @param amount 
 * @param category The type of transfer.  Possible values:   - **bank**: Transfer to a [transfer instrument](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/legalentity/latest/post/transferInstruments__resParam_id) or a bank account.  - **internal**: Transfer to another [balance account](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/balanceplatform/latest/post/balanceAccounts__resParam_id) within your platform.  - **issuedCard**: Transfer initiated by a Adyen-issued card.  - **platformPayment**: Fund movements related to payments that are acquired for your users.
 * @param counterparty 
 * @param balanceAccountId The unique identifier of the source [balance account](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/balanceplatform/latest/post/balanceAccounts__resParam_id).
 * @param description Your description for the transfer. It is used by most banks as the transfer description. We recommend sending a maximum of 140 characters, otherwise the description may be truncated.  Supported characters: **[a-z] [A-Z] [0-9] / - ?** **: ( ) . , ' + Space**  Supported characters for **regular** and **fast** transfers to a US counterparty: **[a-z] [A-Z] [0-9] & $ % # @** **~ = + - _ ' \" ! ?**
 * @param paymentInstrumentId The unique identifier of the source [payment instrument](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/balanceplatform/latest/post/paymentInstruments__resParam_id).
 * @param priority The priority for the bank transfer. This sets the speed at which the transfer is sent and the fees that you have to pay. Required for transfers with `category` **bank**.  Possible values:  * **regular**: For normal, low-value transactions.  * **fast**: Faster way to transfer funds but has higher fees. Recommended for high-priority, low-value transactions.  * **wire**: Fastest way to transfer funds but has the highest fees. Recommended for high-priority, high-value transactions.  * **instant**: Instant way to transfer funds in [SEPA countries](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/integration/retail/sepa/html/index.en.html).  * **crossBorder**: High-value transfer to a recipient in a different country.  * **internal**: Transfer to an Adyen-issued business bank account (by bank account number/IBAN).
 * @param reference Your reference for the transfer, used internally within your platform. If you don't provide this in the request, Adyen generates a unique reference.
 * @param referenceForBeneficiary  A reference that is sent to the recipient. This reference is also sent in all webhooks related to the transfer, so you can use it to track statuses for both the source and recipient of funds.   Supported characters: **a-z**, **A-Z**, **0-9**. The maximum length depends on the `category`.  - **internal**: 80 characters  - **bank**: 35 characters when transferring to an IBAN, 15 characters for others.
