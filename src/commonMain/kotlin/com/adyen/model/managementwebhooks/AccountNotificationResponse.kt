/**
 * Management Webhooks
 *
 * Adyen uses webhooks to inform your system about events that happen with your Adyen company and merchant accounts, stores, payment terminals, and payment methods when using [Management API](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/ManagementService/latest/overview).  When an event occurs, Adyen makes an HTTP POST request to a URL on your server and includes the details of the event in the request body.  See [Webhooks](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks) for more information.
