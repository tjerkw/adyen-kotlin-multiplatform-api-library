/**
 * Adyen Payout API
 *
 * A set of API endpoints that allow you to store payout details, confirm, or decline a payout.  For more information, refer to [Online payouts](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/online-payouts). ## Authentication To use the Payout API, you need to have [two API credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/online-payouts#payouts-to-bank-accounts-and-wallets): one for storing payout details and submitting payouts, and another one for confirming or declining payouts. If you don't have the required API credentials, contact our [Support Team](https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/requests/new).  If using an API key, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:   ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ ... ```  Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using [basic authentication](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#basic-authentication).  The following example shows how to authenticate your request with basic authentication when submitting a payout:  ``` curl -U \"storePayout@Company.YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT\":\"YOUR_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ ... ```  ## Versioning Payments API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payout/v68/payout ```  ## Going live  To authenticate to the live endpoints, you need [API credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.  The live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account: ```  https://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/Payout/v68/payout ```  Get your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.

/**
 * 
 *
 * @param amount 
 * @param merchantAccount The merchant account identifier, with which you want to process the transaction.
 * @param reference The reference to uniquely identify a payment. This reference is used in all communication with you about the payment status. We recommend using a unique value per payment; however, it is not a requirement. If you need to provide multiple references for a transaction, separate them with hyphens (\"-\"). Maximum length: 80 characters.
 * @param billingAddress 
 * @param card 
 * @param fraudOffset An integer value that is added to the normal fraud score. The value can be either positive or negative.
 * @param fundSource 
 * @param recurring 
 * @param selectedRecurringDetailReference The `recurringDetailReference` you want to use for this payment. The value `LATEST` can be used to select the most recently stored recurring detail.
 * @param shopperEmail The shopper's email address. We recommend that you provide this data, as it is used in velocity fraud checks. > For 3D Secure 2 transactions, schemes require `shopperEmail` for all browser-based and mobile implementations.
 * @param shopperInteraction Specifies the sales channel, through which the shopper gives their card details, and whether the shopper is a returning customer. For the web service API, Adyen assumes Ecommerce shopper interaction by default.  This field has the following possible values: * `Ecommerce` - Online transactions where the cardholder is present (online). For better authorisation rates, we recommend sending the card security code (CSC) along with the request. * `ContAuth` - Card on file and/or subscription transactions, where the cardholder is known to the merchant (returning customer). If the shopper is present (online), you can supply also the CSC to improve authorisation (one-click payment). * `Moto` - Mail-order and telephone-order transactions where the shopper is in contact with the merchant via email or telephone. * `POS` - Point-of-sale transactions where the shopper is physically present to make a payment using a secure payment terminal.
 * @param shopperName 
 * @param shopperReference Required for recurring payments.  Your reference to uniquely identify this shopper, for example user ID or account ID. Minimum length: 3 characters. > Your reference must not include personally identifiable information (PII), for example name or email address.
 * @param telephoneNumber The shopper's telephone number.
