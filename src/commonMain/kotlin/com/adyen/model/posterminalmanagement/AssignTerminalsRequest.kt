/**
 * POS Terminal Management API
 *
 * This API provides endpoints for managing your point-of-sale (POS) payment terminals. You can use the API to obtain information about a specific terminal, retrieve overviews of your terminals and stores, and assign terminals to a merchant account or store.  For more information, refer to [Assign terminals](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/automating-terminal-management/assign-terminals-api).  ## Authentication Each request to the Terminal Management API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:  ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\ ... ``` Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).  ## Versioning Terminal Management API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://postfmapi-test.adyen.com/postfmapi/terminal/v1/getTerminalsUnderAccount ``` When using versioned endpoints, Boolean response values are returned in string format: `\"true\"` or `\"false\"`. If you omit the version from the endpoint URL, Boolean response values are returned like this: `true` or `false`.

 * @param companyAccount Your company account. To return terminals to the company inventory, specify only this parameter and the `terminals`.
 * @param terminals Array containing a list of terminal IDs that you want to assign or reassign to the merchant account or store, or that you want to return to the company inventory.  For example, `[\"V400m-324689776\",\"P400Plus-329127412\"]`.
 * @param merchantAccount Name of the merchant account. Specify this parameter to assign terminals to this merchant account or to a store under this merchant account.
 * @param merchantInventory Boolean that indicates if you are assigning the terminals to the merchant inventory. Do not use when assigning terminals to a store. Required when assigning the terminal to a merchant account.  - Set this to **true** to assign the terminals to the merchant inventory. This also means that the terminals cannot be boarded.  - Set this to **false** to assign the terminals to the merchant account as in-store terminals. This makes the terminals ready to be boarded and to process payments through the specified merchant account.
 * @param store The store code of the store that you want to assign the terminals to.
