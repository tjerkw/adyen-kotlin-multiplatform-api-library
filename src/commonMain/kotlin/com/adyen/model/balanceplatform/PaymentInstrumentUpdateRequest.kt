/**
 * Configuration API
 *
 * The Configuration API enables you to create a platform where you can onboard your users as account holders and create balance accounts, cards, and business accounts.  ## Authentication Your Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:   ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ ... ```  Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:  ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -U \"ws@BalancePlatform.YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM\":\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\" \\ ... ``` ## Versioning The Configuration API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/bcl/v2/accountHolders ``` ## Going live When going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API credential for the live environment. You can then use the API key or the username and password to send requests to `https://balanceplatform-api-live.adyen.com/bcl/v2`.

 * 
 *
 * @param balanceAccountId The unique identifier of the balance account associated with this payment instrument. >You can only change the balance account ID if the payment instrument has **inactive** status.
 * @param card 
 * @param status The status of the payment instrument. If a status is not specified when creating a payment instrument, it is set to **active** by default. However, there can be exceptions for cards based on the `card.formFactor` and the `issuingCountryCode`. For example, when issuing physical cards in the US, the default status is **inactive**.  Possible values:    * **active**:  The payment instrument is active and can be used to make payments.    * **inactive**: The payment instrument is inactive and cannot be used to make payments.    * **suspended**: The payment instrument is suspended, either because it was stolen or lost.    * **closed**: The payment instrument is permanently closed. This action cannot be undone.   
 * @param statusComment Comment for the status of the payment instrument.  Required if `statusReason` is **other**.
 * @param statusReason The reason for updating the status of the payment instrument.  Possible values: **lost**, **stolen**, **damaged**, **suspectedFraud**, **expired**, **endOfLife**, **accountClosure**, **other**. If the reason is **other**, you must also send the `statusComment` parameter describing the status change.
