/**
 * Configuration webhooks
 *
 * Adyen sends webhooks to inform your system about events that occur in your platform. These events include, for example, when an account holder's capabilities are updated, or when a sweep configuration is created or updated.  When an event occurs, Adyen makes an HTTP POST request to a URL on your server and includes the details of the event in the request body.  You can use these webhooks to build your implementation. For example, you can use this information to update internal statuses when the status of a capability is changed.

 * @param type The schedule type.  Possible values:  * **cron**: push out funds based on a `cronExpression`.  * **daily**: push out funds daily at 07:00 AM CET.  * **weekly**: push out funds every Monday at 07:00 AM CET.  * **monthly**: push out funds every first of the month at 07:00 AM CET.  * **balance**: pull in funds instantly if the balance is less than or equal to the `triggerAmount`. You can only use this for sweeps of `type` **pull** and when the source is a `merchantAccount` or `transferInstrument`. If the source is transferInstrument, merchant account identifier is still required, with which you want to process the transaction. 
 * @param cronExpression A [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression) that is used to set the sweep schedule. The schedule uses the time zone of the balance account.  For example, **30 17 * * MON** schedules a sweep every Monday at 17:30.  The expression must have five values separated by a single space in the following order:  * Minute: **0-59**  * Hour: **0-23**  * Day of the month: **1-31**  * Month: **1-12** or **JAN-DEC**  * Day of the week: **0-7** (0 and 7 are Sunday) or **MON-SUN**.  The following non-standard characters are supported: **&ast;**, **L**, **#**, **W** and **_/_**. See [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/) for more examples.  Required when `type` is **cron**.
