/**
 * Configuration webhooks
 *
 * Adyen sends webhooks to inform your system about events that occur in your platform. These events include, for example, when an account holder's capabilities are updated, or when a sweep configuration is created or updated.  When an event occurs, Adyen makes an HTTP POST request to a URL on your server and includes the details of the event in the request body.  You can use these webhooks to build your implementation. For example, you can use this information to update internal statuses when the status of a capability is changed.

/**
 * 
 *
 * @param allowed Indicates whether the supporting entity capability is allowed. Adyen sets this to **true** if the verification is successful and the account holder is permitted to use the capability.
 * @param allowedLevel The capability level that is allowed for the account holder.  Possible values: **notApplicable**, **low**, **medium**, **high**.
 * @param enabled Indicates whether the capability is enabled. If **false**, the capability is temporarily disabled for the account holder.
 * @param id The ID of the supporting entity.
 * @param requested Indicates whether the capability is requested. To check whether the account holder is permitted to use the capability, refer to the `allowed` field.
 * @param requestedLevel The requested level of the capability. Some capabilities, such as those used in [card issuing](https://docs.adyen.com/issuing/add-capabilities#capability-levels), have different levels. Levels increase the capability, but also require additional checks and increased monitoring.  Possible values: **notApplicable**, **low**, **medium**, **high**.
 * @param verificationStatus The status of the verification checks for the supporting entity capability.  Possible values:  * **pending**: Adyen is running the verification.  * **invalid**: The verification failed. Check if the `errors` array contains more information.  * **valid**: The verification has been successfully completed.  * **rejected**: Adyen has verified the information, but found reasons to not allow the capability.
