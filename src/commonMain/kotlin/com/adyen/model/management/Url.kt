/**
 * Management API
 *
 * Configure and manage your Adyen company and merchant accounts, stores, and payment terminals. ## Authentication Each request to the Management API must be signed with an API key. [Generate your API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key) in the Customer Area and then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value.  To access the live endpoints, you need to generate a new API key in your live Customer Area. ## Versioning  Management API handles versioning as part of the endpoint URL. For example, to send a request to this version of the `/companies/{companyId}/webhooks` endpoint, use:  ```text https://management-test.adyen.com/v3/companies/{companyId}/webhooks ```  ## Going live  To access the live endpoints, you need an API key from your live Customer Area. Use this API key to make requests to:  ```text https://management-live.adyen.com/v3 ```  ## Release notes Have a look at the [release notes](https://docs.adyen.com/release-notes/management-api) to find out what changed in this version!
